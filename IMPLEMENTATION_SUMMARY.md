} elseif ($totalPoints >= 6) {
    $rating = 'Medium';
    $acceptance = 'Accept with conditions';
    $monitoring = 'Enhanced monitoring';

    $monitoring = 'Standard monitoring';
}
```

### Professional Report Generation:
- Executive summary with key metrics
- Risk distribution analysis
- Client acceptance statistics
- Detailed assessment listings
- Professional PDF formatting

### User Permission System:
```php
